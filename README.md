# Simple Discord Bot Template

To run the bot either use `node .` or `node index.js`.
The bot will not run unless you have filled in the token, clientId and guildId into config.json.
If there are any errors head to my support server: https://exilya.uk.
Make sure to read any comments as they are useful.

Enjoy!
